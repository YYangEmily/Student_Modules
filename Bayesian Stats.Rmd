## Get Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(coda)
library(rjags) 
set.seed(812) # set seed, i'm a leo it's my birthday <3; feel free to change it up <3
titi_ppt <- rpois(n = 7, lambda = 13.8) # "collect" data via playback point transect
titi_homerange <- rpois(n = 7, lambda = 16) # "collect" data via homerange

# are these consistent with 15 groups?
t.test(titi_homerange, alternative = "greater", mu = 15) # is homerange more than 15

t.test(titi_ppt, alternative = "less", mu = 15) # is ppt greater than 15

t.test(titi_homerange, titi_ppt)
```

## JAGS 

```{r}
n_iter <- 20000 # we're going to generate 20000 samples
n_burnin <- 5000 # we're going to throw 5000 samples away as the model gets comfy
n_adapt <- 5000 # we're  going throw another 5000 samples away 
# we're going to have a total of 10000 samples at the end of the data

n_homerange <- length(titi_homerange) 
n_ppt <- length(titi_ppt)
# these just happen to both be 7 but good practice to differentiate

# where do we want our model to start from?
# it doesn't really matter but why not start at the mean?
homerange_init <- mean(titi_homerange)
ppt_init <- mean(titi_ppt)

# note spoiler

# JAGS hates normal R data, you need to make a separate list for **JAGS**  <3
jags_data <- list(n_homerange = n_homerange, n_ppt = n_ppt, 
                  homerange = titi_homerange, ppt = titi_ppt)
jags_init <- list(lambda1 = homerange_init, 
                  lambda2 = ppt_init) # oi jags innit
```

## Picking Priors

```{r}
# Unif(10, 20)
x <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.01)
plot(x, dunif(x, min = 10, max = 20), type = "l", 
     main = "Uniform?",
     xlab = "Prior values",
     ylab = "Probabilities")

# Normal(15, 3)
x <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.01)
plot(x, dnorm(x, mean = 15, sd = 3), type = "l", 
     main = "Normal?",
     xlab = "Prior values",
     ylab = "Probabilities")

# Gamma(15, 1)
x <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.01)
plot(x, dgamma(x, shape = 15, rate = 1), type = "l", 
     main = "Gamma?",
     xlab = "Prior values",
     ylab = "Probabilities")
```

## Gamma JAGS

```{r}

set.seed(812) # feel free to change my seed <3
# we first need to make the model
jags_model <- "model{
  # likelihood
  for(i in 1:n_homerange){
  homerange[i] ~ dpois(lambda1)
  }
  for (i in 1:n_ppt){
  ppt[i] ~ dpois(lambda2)
  }
  
  # prior
  lambda1 ~ dgamma(15, 1)
  lambda2 ~ dgamma(15, 1)
}"

fit <- jags.model(textConnection(jags_model),
               data = jags_data, inits = jags_init, 
               n.chains = 2, n.adapt = n_adapt) # what do the chains do?

fit_samples <- coda.samples(fit, c("lambda1", "lambda2"), n.iter = n_iter) %>% 
  window(start = n_burnin + n_adapt) # let's get our samples <3

plot(window(fit_samples), density = FALSE) # this is a trace plot (tells us where we're randomly walking)

plot(window(fit_samples), trace = FALSE) # this is a density plot (you know what this is!)
summary(window(fit_samples)) # these are our samples
fit_samples <- as.data.frame(as.array(fit_samples)) # got to make a df

acf(fit_samples$lambda1.1)
acf(fit_samples$lambda1.2)
acf(fit_samples$lambda2.1)
acf(fit_samples$lambda2.2)

fit_samples <- data.frame(homerange = 
                            c(fit_samples[, "lambda1.1"], 
                              fit_samples[, "lambda1.2"]),
                          ppt = 
                            c(fit_samples[, "lambda2.1"],
                                  fit_samples[, "lambda2.2"]))
```
